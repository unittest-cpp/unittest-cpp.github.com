The last few months have been a busy time for me as I have been in the process of changing day jobs. Now that things are settled down, I am finally getting around to wrapping up UnitTest++ version 1.5. Here is a quick update:

### Documentation

The main README file has been updated with a few more details and now points to the wiki documentation, which I am starting to populate. Your contributions are more than welcome here! I have also chosen, for better or for worse, to use git submodules to include the wiki along with the source download. This seems like a logical thing to do, but submodules do have their oddities so I'm keeping an open mind.

### Discussions

At this point, the occasional discussion still trickles through on the old SourceForge mailing list. Myself and others have clearly been happy to answer questions on this list, and will continue to do so as long as the list remains active. At the same time, discussions seem to be happening on issues and pull requests like [this one](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/pull/31), and most recently [this one](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/pull/40). This is great, and I appreciate all of the valuable feedback.

Because of these discussions I have added a 'discussion' tag to the issue tracker. I see a slight difference between this and a 'question'. I have seeded the [first discussion here](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/issues/42).
