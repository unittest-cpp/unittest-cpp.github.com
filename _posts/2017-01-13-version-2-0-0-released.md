The release of version 2.0 of UnitTest++ is complete. This marks the first 
interface breaking changes to UnitTest++ since adopting semantic versioning,
although admittedly a minor one. You can read more about that breaking change
in my [previous post] [1]. The full list of [issues and pull requests are here]
[2].

It also marks our first release of 2017, and it has me pondering what we
accomplished in 2016, as well as what I'd like to accomplish in the year to
come. I'll be going through my notes and putting some more thought into this
in the weeks to come.
